# Question: How do you find the first bad version in a series of versions using minimum API calls? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code is designed to find the first bad version in a series of versions using the minimum number of API calls. The function `isBadVersion(version)` is a placeholder for an API call that would return whether a given version is bad or not. For the purpose of this problem, it is assumed that versions higher than 5 are bad. The function `findFirstBadVersion(n)` uses a binary search algorithm to find the first bad version. It starts by setting the start to 1 and the end to n. It then enters a while loop that continues until the start is less than the end. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the mid-point between the start and end, and checks if this mid version is bad. If it is, it sets the end to the mid-point, otherwise, it sets the start to one more than the mid-point. This process continues until the start is no longer less than the end, at which point it returns the start, which is the first bad version. The binary search algorithm ensures that the minimum number of API calls are made.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript version, using a binary search algorithm to minimize the number of API calls. The main difference is that the TypeScript version uses classes and inheritance, which are features of object-oriented programming. 

In the TypeScript version, the `isBadVersion` function is a method of the `VersionControl` class, and the `findFirstBadVersion` function is a method of the `Solution` class, which extends `VersionControl`. This means that an instance of the `Solution` class has access to the `isBadVersion` method. 

Another difference is that the TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of the parameters and return values of the functions. For example, the `isBadVersion` method has a parameter `version` of type `number` and a return type of `boolean`. This can help catch errors at compile time, before the code is run.

Finally, the TypeScript version uses different variable names (`left` and `right` instead of `start` and `end`), but this does not affect how the code works.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using a binary search algorithm. They both start by setting the start (or left) to 1 and the end (or right) to n. They then enter a while loop where they calculate the mid-point between the start and end. If the mid-point is a bad version, they set the end to the mid-point, otherwise they set the start to one more than the mid-point. They continue this process until the start and end converge, at which point they return the start (or left) as the first bad version.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. In the C++ version, the `isBadVersion` function is declared before it is used, whereas in JavaScript, function declarations are hoisted, so they can be used before they are declared.

2. The C++ version uses the `iostream` library for console input and output, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `console.log` function for output.

3. The C++ version uses the `cin` and `cout` objects for input and output, whereas the JavaScript version does not require any user input and uses `console.log` for output.

4. The C++ version uses the `main` function as the entry point of the program, whereas the JavaScript version does not require a specific entry point function.

5. The C++ version uses static typing, requiring the type of each variable to be declared, whereas JavaScript uses dynamic typing, so variable types do not need to be declared.

6. The C++ version uses integer division when calculating the mid-point, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `Math.floor` function to achieve the same result.
